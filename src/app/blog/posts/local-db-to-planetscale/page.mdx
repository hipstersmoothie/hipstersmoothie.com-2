# Importing a Local Database into Planetscale

If you have a database on your computer that you want to upload to planetscale.com this note will walk you through it.

## 1. Create a new database on Planetscale

First head to your planetscale.com dashboard and click the `New Database` button.
On the next page click `Import`.

## 2. Expose your local database

For this step you will need to download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).
`ngrok` is a tiny tool that exposes a local port to the internet through a URL making it easy to access.

Once you have `ngrok` installed run the following command to expose the port your `mysyql` server is running on. The default port is `3309`.

```sh
ngrok tcp 3309
```

## 3. Prepare you `mysql` server

### 3.a Create a password

If you already have a password for your sql user you're already done with this step! Otherwise run the following commands while connected to your `mysql` server:

```sh
mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD
```

### 3.b Enabled `gtid` mode

Now you need to configure a few things in your `mysql` server to make it available to Planetscale.

Run the following commands while connected:

```sh
SET @@GLOBAL.ENFORCE_GTID_CONSISTENCY = WARN;
SET @@GLOBAL.ENFORCE_GTID_CONSISTENCY = ON;
SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE = OFF_PERMISSIVE;
SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE = ON_PERMISSIVE;
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'ONGOING_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTION_COUNT';
```

When the last command displays a `0` in the output run this command

```sh
SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_MODE = ON;
```

## 4. Fill in the details in the import screen

Use the the url and port displayed by `ngrok`.

Then fill in your credentials and click `Test connection`. Hopefully this works!
On the next screen just click `Enable Primary Mode` and `Finish Import` to complete the process.

## Done!

That's it! Hopefully this helped you get your data imported ðŸŽ‰
