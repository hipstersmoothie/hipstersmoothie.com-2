There are many ways to organize your project's compositions in [Descript](https://www.descript.com/). This is the structure I use to edit and produce content from my podcast [[devtools-fm]].

## The Multi-Track Sequence

I record my podcast on [riverside.fm](https://riverside.fm) and it outputs each person on the podcast as a video with only that person's video and audio. I upload these files into Descript then transcribe them as a single multi-track sequence. This both saves on transcription cost (it's only one file) and makes it easy to edit later in the process.

## The "Episode N" Composition

Every episode project has a composition titled "Episode N" with the multi-track sequence of the podcast participants. This is where all of the main editing for the podcast happens.

## "Raw Video" Folder

While the main composition is great for doing all of our work in, it can become hard to see whats gone after a lot of editing. To accommodate for this I create a "Raw Video" folder in the project. This folder houses an unedited composition of each podcast participant so I can easily see the original content along with it's transcript.

## "[[Podcast Social Clips|Social Clips]]" Folder

While I'm editing the main composition I make sure to highlight sections of the podcast I think would make good clips for sharing across social media websites.

Once I'm ready to start editing on of these clips I highlight the text in the main composition, right click, and clip my selection to a new composition. I put all of these clips in the "Social Clips" folder. Here I can edit the clips down further for the various platforms we advertise the week's episode.

The "Social Clips" folder has another folder within it named "Published". Once I have scheduled one of the clips to be posted (I use [later.com](https://later.com)), I move the clip into the "Published" sub-folder so I don't accidentally post it again.

## "YouTube Clips" Folder

We publish [our podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFsRlOn7gODgv6WUriLrzXg) to YouTube, and we also have a [secondary channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtKRj3QiajrQpObzOO0V3yg) where we post sections of the podcast for easier consumption.

When we edit a podcast the last step is to add [section markers](https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042210672-Markers) to the script. These make it super simple to find YouTube clips, any section the is longer than 8 minutes becomes a clip in the YouTube clips folder. I create new compositions of them in the same way that I do for social clips. From the composition I will publish them to the secondary channel directly in Descript.
