The one rule I've come to with my home automation set up is that under no circumstances should the automation ever feel stupid or annoying.  This means you should never feel like those lights are turning off too quick or the automation is running when you don't want it to. The seconds home automation starts doing things when you don't want them to your home automation setup is working _against you_ and not working _for you_.
