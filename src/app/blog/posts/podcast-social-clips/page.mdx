<PostHeader slug="podcast-social-clips" />

In the week leading up to the release of one of my episodes of [[devtools-fm]], I create short video clips to share on social media to promote the upcoming episode.

While editing the podcast I'll highlight ~2m sections of the podcast the could be distilled down into an interesting clip. Depending on the quality of the video, including how many cuts I have to make to fit in the content limits, I may release the clip as an [audiogram](https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042638351-Audiograms)

## Platform Content Limits

- [Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-videos) => 2m 30s
- [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/270963803047681) => 60s
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/formedia/solutions/video) => 4h (For our use limit to 2m 30s)
- [LinkedIn](https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-video/) => 30m (For our use limit to 2m 30s)
