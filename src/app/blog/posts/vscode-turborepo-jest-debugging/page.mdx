Turborepo is a great tool for managing monorepos, but it's a lot of configuration.

One common workflow for debugging tests is to use the VSCode debugger to attach to the test runner.
All available documentation online assumes that `jest` is installed at the root of the project.
This goes against the default recommendations of `turborepo` which suggests to install and configure `jest` in each package.

The following is what they all recommend.
Here we use the `jest` package in the root of the project.
VSCode provides a way to match the root of the vscode project, but no way to match the current monorepo package.
This is a problem because we could be on different versions of `jest` in different packages and have wildly different configurations.

```json title="./vscode/launch.json" {8}
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug Current Test File",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest",
            "args": ["--runInBand", "--testPathPattern", "${relativeFile}"],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
            "autoAttachChildProcesses": true,
            "protocol": "inspector",
            "showAsyncStacks": true,
        },
    ]
}
```

To fix this we can write our own `program` that will find the closes package dir and instead run tests from there.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const [, , ...args] = process.argv;
const file = args[2];

function findClosestPackageDir(file) {
    const dir = path.dirname(file);
    const packageJson = path.join(dir, 'package.json');

    if (fs.existsSync(packageJson)) {
        return dir;
    }

    return findClosestPackageDir(dir);
}

const packageDir = findClosestPackageDir(file);

process.chdir(packageDir);

require('child_process').spawnSync('pnpm', ['jest', ...args], {
    stdio: 'inherit',
});
```

Now all we need to do is update the `program` in the `launch.json` file.

```json title="./vscode/launch.json" {5}
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            // ...
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/scripts/debug-test.js",
        },
    ]
}
```

Now when we try to debug a test it will run from the closest package dir, using the `jest` executable for the package as well as it's unique configuration.
